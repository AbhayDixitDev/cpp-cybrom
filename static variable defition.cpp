Static Variables, Static functions in oops:
	it is a special variable whose memory allocation is done at static area of memory.
	for all object only one static variable is created.
	
	
	1) for all object having static variable only one memory block is allocated in global/static area.
	2) when we want to manipulate data we must done it with the help of class only (not with object)
	3) make a static function in class which function in class which can manipulate this static variable
	
	
	task:
		static variable and static function without oops.
